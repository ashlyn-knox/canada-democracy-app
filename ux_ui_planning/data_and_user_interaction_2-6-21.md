# Data and User Interaction Brainstorming Notes
* June 2, 2021

To guide the design process and figure out how things will need to be put together and where data will need to come from.

## 1st Set of Questions to Solve
Types of Questions and initial ones to solve
### User Focused
* What can users do?
* How will users do these things?
* Why will users do these things?
* What types of incentives will users have?
* How will abusive behaviour be mitigated?
* How will users be protected?

#### What can users do on this app
1. Vote on bills
  - Vote on bills currently in the house of commons
  - Vote on bills proposed by other users
2. Propose bills
  - Create their own bills
  - Propose addendums to bills
* **NOTE**: This starts to feel like a model parliament game which could alienate a lot of participation. Need a system that has faster turnover time, less reading, and more user feedback without it feeling like a cheap game.
3. Comment on, like parts of, dislike parts of, tag other users to bills
4. Gain awards for participation (what benefits would be fair and promote increased usage?)
5. Flag abusive content
  - This will require active moderators
6. Vote on and discuss bills and motions being passed in the house of commons
7. Learn how to be involved in self governance
  - In order to make this user friendly , a tutorial system of some type needs to be built in that provides visual feedback to build confidence and knowledge in users
8. Collaborate with small teams to draft bills
  - I think that limiting direct messaging is a good idea. The goal isn't to create a social media app. it's meant to facilitate political engagement and collaboration. 
  - Consider taking notes from how github works?

### How will users do these things?
* Have their own political space
* tag issues that are important to them
*

### Data Focused
* What essential data is needed for core functionality of this app?
* What data can users access?
* How will they access it and what can they do with it?
* What data will be needed for secondary and supplementary features?
