# Literature Review
Notes on articles relating to democracy voting apps

## Focus Questions
* Are there any points that address issues that I am facing?
  * What are they?
* Are there any points that address issues that I haven't thought of?
  * What are they?
* What values directed their development?
* What are my first impressions of their app?
* Provide Notes on the workflow described for their app.

## Mi-Vote
* [Fast Company Article](https://www.fastcompany.com/3063379/can-direct-democracy-be-revived-through-new-voting-apps)
  * Article date: 2016
* [Mi-Vote App Site](https://www.mi-vote.com)
* An App aimed to rethink how citizens particpate in governance
### Useflow Notes
* App gives users a notification when a new issue is being addressed in parliament
  * Votes are then given a digital information packet that is made by researchers that helps them dive into different approaches
  * **NOTE: This approach would require someone to actively put together packets of information** 
* Instead of putting the bill or piece of legislation first. They view the bill as a contract, instead of presenting voters with contract oriented information first, they what the arrangement would like like and what it would solve first, **the deal** first.
  * example: if immigration is to be voted on, users would be proposed a humanitarian appraoch, a border security approach, a finacial pragmatic approach, and international relations approach. 
    * for each of these, the app will give lots of information on them
    * this is meant to help users vote with their values and become informed with their perspective in mind
* **Solutions approach** vs **ideological approach**

### Issues and Takeaways
* User security: blockchain
* Addressed point of ideological basis of politics -- seeks to empower voters by creating an approach based on results
  * I'd argue that their setup is still ideological in their 4 perspective focus. These frames essentially turn into ideological groups and enables users to stay their echo chamber
  * The solution focus is good though, and presenting issues related to the bill to contextualize it is really good
    * **issue** how would this get maintained? when it comes to quality of information and source diversity, this could become a hairy area. 
      * **solutions*
        * 1. Users can upload information
        * 2. app scrapers gather information from set sources (this could become overloaded quickly) 
        * 3. moderators are partially responsible for providing context information
        * 4. bill proposers are required to provide sources

## Swiss App
* [digital democracy article](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/digital-democracy_app-launched-to-help-swiss-voters/44680626)
* [VOTEinfo](https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/statistiken/politik/abstimmungen/voteinfo.html)
* Date published: 2019

### Notes
* App that provides background information and results of all national votes
* Focused on empowering users to educate themselves
* users get reminders to vote
* Developed by Swiss Federal Government
* Development cost $153,000
* yearly operating cost $100,000
* **does not** offer information on candidates running for elections
  * [smartvote](https://smartvote.ch/de/home) is a questionnaire meant to help users pick a candidate that fits their values
### Issues and Takeaways
* High cost to make this and maintain it
* App is primarily informational

## VoteFlux
* One person one vote, can trade votes on issues that you don't care about
* Bills are focused on (in contrast to MiVote). Summaries are written and shown to users
