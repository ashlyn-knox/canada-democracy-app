# Design Patterns Scratchpad 07-06-2021
Follow up with ux research with brainstormed ideas on how to use different UI elements
* [UI-Patterns Website](http://ui-patterns.com/patterns).
## Problem: Inform voters about effects of bills --categories
I like how MiVote uses different solution value focuses to frame approaches to solving an issue and then follows that line of logic to bill propositions. I also like how voteflux has a summary written for each bill. These two combined offer inductive-deductive blended focuses.
* This could be done with colour coding and creating logos for each info type
* Issue: how will this information be entered and accessed?
 - Users should get exposed to a variety of points, and this could get pretty busy fast.
### UI Solution: Get users' information that will show multiple perspectives, but not overhwhelm the user.
* Community Driven UI Elements
  - Flagging and Reporting
  - Vote to Promote
  - Rate Content (rate quality of information for instance)
* Content Elements
  - Tags
  - Categorization
  - Favorites
  - Thumbnails
* Comprehension
  - Recognition over recall
  - Chunking (group information into familiar, manageable units)

## Problem: Determine Priority of issues and perspective types
People prioritize information differently. One of the big evils of social media is how it enables confirmation bias and echo chambers. This app will need to find a balance between people's priorities and other important information that they still need to take into account to avoid providing another echo chamber.

### UI Solution: Periodically get information explicitly from users about value based information. Record and analyze voting history and engagement history
* Forms
  - Input feedback
  - Survey

## Problem: Onboarding and tailoring political engagement
Getting people on the app, getting them to feel confident and engaged, and then keeping them on it. Many people deal with information differently.

### UI Solution: 
* Onboarding
  - walkthrough
  guided tour
  inline hints
* Registration
  - lazy registration
  - account registration
* Gameplay Rewards
  - achievements
  - delighters
* Timing
  - Feedback loop
  - Tailoring
  - Trigger
* Fundamentals of Rewards
  - Fixed Rewards
  - Variable Rewards
* Explaining the process
  - Steps left
  - completeness meter
