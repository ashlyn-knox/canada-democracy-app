# Airbnb notes
The client referred to Airbnb a few times when we were talking about verification, sign up, and UI. I'm reviewing it's implications for this project here.
* Just a brief review

## General Thoughts
* Method of education on what the site is and how to get involved is great, I want to draw content-layout inspiration from how they have put this together
* small things like message indicator on signup in topbar-home, and the popup newsletter box that shows up in the bottom right of the page (stops page scroll when cursor is over it)
* Hero on homepage isn't stagenant. Often heros are great to look at but kinda not great for usefulness.
    - note: pink is used to denote the search function and not the button under the Heading. Heading is meant to draw user to find out about cool places
    - **IDEA: this could be emulated by providng access to current bills that are trending with high engagement, or new bills- can be designed to update daily and be regionally relevant (give user option with their account to make this only related to their region, or to be specifically varied). Could also get user location information from their browser -- though this might be unnecessarily invasive feeling.**
    - 2 menus + a hamburger. Not annoying because it's all petty useful, the search bar is light + pink seach icon, approx 30vw. more descriptive than a general search, but still flexible (location, check in, check out, guests)
        - translate to Location (city, riding...), topic, active bills, general search
        - menu above is strictly informational, 20vw, small underlines for active page

## Signup
* access with google, fb, email, apple
* phone number for confirmation
* Contrast with background shading and pink continue button is really nicely done.
* **Good idea** when you first go to the site, the login icon has a little dot over it that's like when you get a message on a social media app. this draws attention to sign up

## Become a host
* hero feels more personal than the landing page hero, has a person looking at camera, text with pink get started button. subtext proposes an argument/reason for why you might want to get started.
* Sticky topbar shows up after you scroll past the hero section
* below hero a 3 card section, hero and two content cards

## Homepage
* About information has limited text with really large images
    - Headlines with single sentence descriptions under images. Images are thematically but not really contentfully relevant to the heading
        - 5 headings visible on desktop with a side arrow to move across more information
    - next row has a large image alongisde "Ask a real host" "GET ANSWERS"(in small caps) with a button to communicate with someone, this is great follow up if the information is not directly answering a question. 

## Regions popup
* This idea could be relevant for how I organize voting districts?
* Choose language and region
    - Could a system like this be useful to allow people to see what's going on in other areas?
