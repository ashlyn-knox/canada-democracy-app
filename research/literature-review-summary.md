# Literature Review Summary Notes
Takeaways from the articles that I've found on the making a direct democracy app.

## Useful Ideas
* Bill Summary system
  * I am inspired by the solutions approach of MiVote, althought I don't particularly like their framework. but giving some sort of system to organize issues. This could be color coded with a logo for each and used as tags
* Swiss App Questionnaire to help voters quickly get an idea for candidates in their riding  
## Relevant Problems
* User adoption: I would like to infer more about how the devs are finding users engaging with their app.
* Manipulation: Special interest groups slanting vote results (a constant political problem)
* average person's political stamina and interest
* politician's need to engage with the app or be engaged by it
  * this could easily become a messy wholesale political dogwhistle bonanza

## Common Goals
* Address disenfranchised voters by giving them a tool to actively participate in politics
* Hold political officials accountable to their constituents
* Modernize democracy
  
## How could I adapt these approaches?
* For the solution information presentation: information should be framed by perspective type. all users would have to go through a cross section of different angles
* Swiss App Candidate Questionnaire
  * This app, if it was developed with support and engagement outside of just myself could include a feature like this to be relevant during an election.
    * however this wouldn't be a focus at this time
  * A questionnaire could be used to filter points from information on each perspective towards solutions
    * A requestionnaire would need to happen from time to time to refresh results based on users' interests
* Questionnaire could also be used to determine priority of bills as they are shown... to avoid "CRISIS ALERT" feel of being potentially overinundated with political content
* Open source influenced information system
  * **NOTE** current idea susceptible to easy tampering
  * Argument information tags, would need
